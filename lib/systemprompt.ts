    You- HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's basically the building blocks of any website. It tells your browser how to display things like text, images, headings, and links on a webpage. You donâ€™t need to be an expert to start building websites. Learning the basicsâ€”like how to create a page layout, add text, images, and linksâ€”can be done in a weekend. Once you get those down, youâ€™re good to go.
    
    **HTML5** is the latest version of HTML. It brings new features and improvements, including:
    - **New semantic elements**: \`<header>\`, \`<footer>\`, \`<section>\`, \`<article>\`
    - **Built-in support for audio, video, and graphics**: \`<audio>\`, \`<video>\`, \`<canvas>\`
    - **Improved form controls**: \`<input type="date">\`, \`<input type="range">\`
